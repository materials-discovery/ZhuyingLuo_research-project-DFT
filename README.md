Title of project:  

Analyze the influence of oxygen vacancies on the M/TiO2 interface by DFT (M=Au, Pt) 

 

Goals (bullet point, short):  

The goal of this project is to use DFT method by using Quantum Espresso to calculate the formation energy of oxygen vacancy and adsorption enthalpy of TiO2/metal interface. Finally determine how the oxygen vacancy influence the TiO2/metal performance. 

 

Methods: (short description, can copy and paste from literature report) 

Aristotle is applied to link to the Linux system of the university. Use first principle of DFT basing on Quantum Espresso to calculate the energy needed and use VESTA for visualization.
